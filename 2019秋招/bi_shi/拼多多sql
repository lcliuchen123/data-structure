拼多多：
    sql查询每个用户的最长连续登录天数：
    思路：如果是连续的日期，每个diff都会出现。
    计算每个日期与所有日期天数的差距。如果不是连续的日期就不会出现。
    最长连续登陆天数可以有间断，比较每个间断最长的。

        (
            select uid,logdate,
            (dateadd(dd,-row_number() over(partation by uid order by logdate),logdate)) as diff //核心
            from table
        );
        with m as
        (
            select uid,min(logdate) as start_day, max(logdate) as end_day,
            datediff(dd,min(logdate),max(logdate)+1) as diff
            from t
            group by uid,diff
